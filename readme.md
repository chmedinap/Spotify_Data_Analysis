# Analyzing Spotify data through the API

To see the interactive document published with Quatro, go to this link: https://spotify.chmedina.com

This is the repository for a data visualization curriculum of interactive notebooks using *[Quarto](https://quarto.org)* and *[Plotly](https://plotly.com/)*. This document was made to be part of my portfolio as a data analyst.

For this book I took one of the subjects that I love the most, music and using the Spotify API and my listening historic data I will explore the many display options we have to display data appropriately.
